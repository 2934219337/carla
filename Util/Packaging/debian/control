Description: Open-source simulator for autonomous driving research
 CARLA has been developed from the ground up to support development, training, and validation
 of autonomous driving systems. In addition to open-source code and protocols, CARLA provides
 open digital assets (urban layouts, buildings, vehicles) that were created for this purpose
 and can be used freely. The simulation platform supports flexible specification of sensor suites,
 environmental conditions, full control of all static and dynamic actors, maps generation and much more.
